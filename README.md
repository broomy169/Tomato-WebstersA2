Assignment 2 for CP1406/CP2010

# Notes

Database Diagram Changes
------------------------
The database diagram "database diagram V002.png" has the XML embedded in it and is therefore able to be opened and edited in draw.io.

Link for .MD file syntax
------------------------
A [Wikipedia entry for markdown files.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

To me it doesn't seem to follow the exact syntax on github as stated on wikipedia but its a good start. :/
